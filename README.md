## Project Portfolios

## 🛡️ IT & Cybersecurity

I'm passionate about cybersecurity and enjoy solving complex, real-world security challenges through hands-on projects.  
My work spans vulnerability management, threat detection, and security operations—focused on practical impact, not theory.

## 🔐 SOC / MSS Security Work (Highlights)

I focus on practical, operations-ready security work: alert triage, vulnerability scanning, secure configuration, and clear client-facing reporting.
